things that we want in the final project:
	(done, needs implementation) box shift
	(done, needs implementation) box color
	(needs to be started)) add and delete frames from anywhere in the project
	(done, needs implementation) save/load/export project
	(needs to be started) save/load stamps
	(done) color wheel
	(done) interactable grid
	(needs to be started) timeline
	(needs to be started) selection tool (right click)
	(done) paint tool (left click)
	(needs to be started) frame duration setting
	(needs to be started) notifications
		do you want to save before exiting?
		do you want to overwrite this file?
