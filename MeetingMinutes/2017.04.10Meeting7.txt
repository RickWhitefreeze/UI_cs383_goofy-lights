meeting 7 4/10/2017

group checkin
	lance & nick - grid is created in the GUI, you can select and draw colors on the active frame, you can make a new project and have it populate with a default color
	Ruth and Micheal - working on it tonight (both were busy all weekend and needed lance and nick's part to begin work)
	Joey and Jocelyn - Save load and export all working

We decided:
	left click = draw 
	rick click = select (for box selection and things like that) one click, then another top left and bottom right
	sizeX and sizeY returned by loadProject are the X and Y of the whole project canvas (3x the size of the final exported frame size)

Jocelyn is printing:
	design specs
	meeting notes
	all the code (without .ui files)
	screenshot of GUI (with labels for things on the GUI)
